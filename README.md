# Breast-Cancer

Project Overview

 we Perform feature extraction by finding out the relationships of each variable with targeted variables. And after that, 
 we conduct the scaling and regression method. Then we make a causal graph. To implement causal graphs we use 
 CausalGraphicalModel is a python module for describing andand the relationship between each other variables. 
 manipulating Causal Graphical Models and Structural Causal Models.
 
 Introduction

Causal Graphs

In statistics, econometrics, epidemiology, genetics, and related disciplines,
causal graphs (also known as path diagrams, causal Bayesian networks, or
DAGs) are probabilistic graphical models used to encode assumptions about
the data-generating process.

Causal graphs can be used for communication and for inference. As
communication devices, the graphs provide a formal and transparent
representation of the causal assumptions that researchers may wish to
convey and defend.

Casual graph models

Graphical causal models are a language for encoding theories, which allows
us to assess their implications and to understand which estimates are, in
principle, causal effects. Modeling causality through graphs brings an
appropriate language to describe the dynamics of causality.

Workflow
● Read the data
● Perform exploratory analysis on it
● Extract features and scale the extracted feature
● Split the data into training and hold-out set
● Create a casual graph using a different technique
● Examine the model performance based on the graph

Skills:
● Modelling a given problem as a causal graph
● Statistical Modelling and Inference Extraction
● Building model pipelines and orchestration

Knowledge:
·● Knowledge about the casual graphs and statistical learning
● Hypothesis Formulation and Testing
● Statistical Analysis

Installation
● pip install causalgraphicalmodels
